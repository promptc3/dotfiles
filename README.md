## Warnings!! and Recommendations

### VIM
1. Escape is Tab
2. CapsLock is Alt
3. CtrlP is easy to setup but slow, fzf is fast but difficult to start with
4. I rarely use Nerdtree, any fuzzyfilefinder is recommended
5. Anything by Tim Pope is useful (;

### i3
1. i3 is a tiling window manager
2. rofi is cool but I use dmenu. It's minimal(like my job)
3. ranger is recommended file manager for i3
4. I've used bumblebee and lemonbar. Finally settled with polybar.

### mutt
1. Most suckless email client.
2. All of them suck, mutt sucks less.
3. w3m and w3m-img can be used to view html and pdfs.
4. offlineimap for offline viewing.

### fish shell and oh-my-fish
1. I choose fish over zsh for its out of the box configuration
2. and easy scripting (and hulk-theme).

### Tilix
1. Horizontal and vertical split, tabs, windows, profiles, synchronous typing
2. Drop down like quake(not Guake, Guake is ugly, terminator is ugly too)
3. Super easy GUI based configuration

## Final Words
If anyone needs any help in setting up these things, email me. I'm never busy (;
